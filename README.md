**Walmart-Sales-Analysis-Project**

**About**

This project leverages Python for data cleaning, SQL for data analysis, and Microsoft Power BI for visualization to explore a Walmart sales dataset. The aim is to utilize 
SQL's robust data manipulation capabilities to uncover insights that could guide business decisions and strategies across various Walmart branches.

**Objectives**

•	To enhance data quality by preprocessing the dataset using Python, ensuring accuracy and reliability for analysis.

•	To conduct comprehensive analysis using SQL to uncover patterns and trends in the sales data.

•	To generate actionable recommendations to optimize sales performance and improve customer satisfaction.

**Data Source**

The dataset, obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, consists of sales transactions from three Walmart branches: Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. It 
includes 17 columns across 1000 rows, detailing transaction specifics vital for our analysis.

**Key Columns**

•	invoice_id, branch, city, customer_type, gender, product_line, unit_price, quantity, total, date, time, payment, gross_income, rating

**Analysis Overview**

1.	Sales Trend Analysis: Evaluate sales across different branches, cities, and times.

2.	Customer Segmentation: Analyze demographics and purchasing behaviors.

3.	Product Analysis: Determine top-performing products and how pricing affects sales.

4.	Time Series Analysis: Explore how sales trends vary by day, month, and year.

5.	Operational Insights: Assess the impact of payment methods on sales and preferences.

6.	Payment Analysis: Examine the distribution and effects of different payment methods.

**Methodology**

•	Data Cleaning: Utilized Python libraries (e.g., Pandas) to prepare the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.

•	SQL Analysis: Performed extensive querying, aggregation, and sorting to analyze the data.

•	Visualization: Used Power BI to create visual representations of the analysis for better comprehension and presentation.

•	Comparative and Trend Analysis: Conducted comparisons and trend analyses across various dimensions using SQL.

**Business Questions**

1.	How do sales figures vary across branches, and why?

2.	What are the key differences in purchasing behavior among demographic groups?

3.	Which products are most popular and profitable?

4.	How do seasonal trends affect sales in different product lines?

5.	What payment methods are most prevalent, and how do they correlate with sales?

**Project Deliverables**

•	Cleaned Dataset: A CSV file of the cleaned dataset, ready for SQL import.

•	SQL Scripts: A collection of SQL scripts used for conducting the analysis.

•	Analysis Report: A comprehensive report detailing the findings from the SQL analysis, including visual graphs and charts.

•	Recommendations Document: Actionable recommendations based on the analysis to enhance sales performance and customer engagement.
